Graph Representation:
The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix, initialized to Integer.MAX_VALUE 
for non-existing edges and 0 for self-loops.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm:
This algorithm finds the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes 
in a graph with non-negative weights.
It uses a priority queue to repeatedly extract the node with the smallest 
tentative distance, updating its neighbors' distances.

Process Nodes:
Each node’s shortest distance is computed by iteratively choosing the unprocessed 
node with the smallest distance, updating its neighbors' distances.

Output:
Print the shortest distances from the source node (node 1) to every other node. 
If a node is unreachable, output -1.
