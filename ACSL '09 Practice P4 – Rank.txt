Graph Representation:
The build_graph function constructs a directed graph where an edge from player 
a to player b represents player a defeating player b.

Cycle Detection:
The detect_cycles function uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. 
Players involved in cycles are stored in the cycle_nodes set.

Recursion Stack: During DFS, the rec_stack tracks nodes currently being visited to 
identify back edges, which indicate a cycle.

Counting Players in Cycles:
After detecting cycles, the size of the cycle_nodes set is returned, which 
represents the number of players whose rankings cannot be determined due to cyclic orderings.
