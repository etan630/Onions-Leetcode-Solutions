Random Guesses: 
It makes random guesses of indices j adn q for thr two permutations A and B

Store Results: 
For each guess, it stores the values A[j] anmd B[q] in two maps, first and second, respectively.

Check for Match: 
It checks if any value from the first map matches a value from the second map. If a match is found, 
it prints the corresponding indices.

Repeat: The process is repeated up to 10,000 times or until a match is found.
