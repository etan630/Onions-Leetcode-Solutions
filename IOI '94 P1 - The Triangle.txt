Dynamic Programming Approach:
The code uses a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to compute the maximum path sum in a triangle.

Algorithm:
Starting from the second-to-last row, update each element by adding the maximum of 
the two possible values below it (left and right diagonals).
Continue this process upwards to the top of the triangle.
The value at the top of the triangle (triangle[0][0]) will hold the maximum path sum from top to base.
