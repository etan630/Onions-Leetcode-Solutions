Euler's Totient Function: The euler function calculates Î¦(n), which helps reduce 
large exponents in modular arithmetic.

Modular Exponentiation: The mod_exp function efficiently computes base^exponent
modmod using exponentiation by squaring.

Tower Power Calculation: The tower_power function calculates the tower's power by iteratively 
reducing the problem using moduli calculated with the Euler function, starting from the top 
block down to the bottom.

Final Output: The result is computed as the power of the tower modulo M
