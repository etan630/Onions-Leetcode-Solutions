Approach:
Knapsack Problem: 
- Model the problem as a variant of the knapsack problem where we balance strengths to maximize the meme value.
Dynamic Programming: 
- Use a DP approach to handle items with both positive and negative strengths.

Key Concepts:
Strength Offset: 
- Strengths are adjusted by shifting to avoid negative indices, using a large enough array.
DP Array:
- Maintain a DP array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum meme value achievable with a strength balance j.

Steps in the Code:
Read Input: 
- Collect strengths and meme values of both mathies and engineers, converting engineers' strengths to negative values.
Initialize DP Table: 
- Set initial values and prepare for DP calculations.
Knapsack Algorithm:
- Update the DP table by considering each itemâ€™s contribution to potential team configurations.
