Input Handling: The program reads 5 integers from the input, each between 2 and 32. 
These numbers are stored in an array.

Factor Counting: For each number, the factor function is called to count the 
prime factors (excluding 1 and the number itself).
    Dividing by 2: The function first divides the number by 2 as many times as possible, 
    counting the number of times it divides evenly. This handles the factor of 2.

    Odd Factors: After removing the factor of 2, the function checks for odd factors 
    starting from 3 and increments the count for each factor found.


    Remaining Prime: If the remaining number is greater than 2 (after removing all factors), 
    it's a prime factor and the count is incremented.

    Final Adjustment: If the count is 1 (meaning the number itself is prime and has no other factors), 
    it is reset to 0, as prime numbers are considered to have no factors in this context.

Output: The total number of factors for each of the 5 input numbers is printed.
