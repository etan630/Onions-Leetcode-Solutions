DP Array:
dp[i] represents the minimum cost to reach stone i.

Transition:
For each stone i, the cost is computed by considering all possible previous stones j 
within the last K jumps and taking the minimum cost from those options.

Initialization:
Start with dp[1] = 0 because the cost to be on the first stone is zero.

Result:
The minimum cost to reach the last stone N is found in dp[N].
