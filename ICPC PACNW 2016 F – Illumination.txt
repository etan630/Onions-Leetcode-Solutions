Objective:
- Determine if it's possible to configure lamps such that no two lamps in the same row or column 
illuminate the same square, while each lamp illuminates a row or column without causing any overlap issues.

Approach:
2-SAT Problem: 
- Model this problem using the 2-SAT problem framework, where each lamp can either 
illuminate its row or its column, and constraints are set to ensure no conflicts.
Implications: 
- Build implications based on overlaps. If two lamps could overlap in their 
illumination, their choices (row or column) are constrained.
SCC (Strongly Connected Components): 
- Use SCC to check if the constraints lead to a valid configuration. If a 
lamp's row option implies its column option and vice versa, it's a conflict.

Steps in the Code:
Map Lamps: 
- Create mappings for rows and columns to track lamps.
Build Graph: 
- Construct a graph representing implications based on potential overlaps of lamp illumination.
Find SCC: 
- Determine SCCs using DFS to check if there's a contradiction (i.e., a lamp's row option being in the same component as its column option).
