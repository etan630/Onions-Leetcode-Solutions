Understanding Responses: 
- Each person's response reflects the minimum label of their neighbors' cards. 
This means each person's card is either equal to this minimum or the solution must 
infer which value fits consistently across all answers.

Initial Solution: 
- For each person, the code checks the responses of their two immediate neighbors. 
Based on their responses, it attempts to deduce the card value:
  - If the minimums of the neighbors are consistent, the card's value is straightforward.
  - Otherwise, the code records possible values for each position.

Determine Exact Values: 
- After identifying possible values for some cards and marking already known values, 
the code attempts to fill in the remaining card values by matching the unvisited cards 
with the possible candidates, ensuring consistency with the given responses.

Final Assignment: 
- The unvisited numbers are sorted and assigned to the positions with possible values 
based on whether the assignment maintains consistency with all given answers.
