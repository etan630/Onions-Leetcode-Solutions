Objective:
Find the minimum number of vertices required in a simple, undirected graph to accommodate exactly M edges.

Concept:
- For a graph with V vertices, the maximum number of edges is given by V×(V−1) / 2 (a complete graph).
- To fit M edges, we need at least V such that V x (V - 1) / 2 ≥M.

Approach:
Estimate V: 
- Use the quadratic formula to estimate the minimum V needed.
- Adjust V: Check if the estimated V satisfies the edge requirement. Increment V if necessary 

Implementation Details:
Compute the initial estimate for V
Increment V until the maximum number of edges for V vertices meets or exceeds M
