Dynamic Programming Approach:
The code uses dynamic programming (DP) to find the minimum cost for the frog to reach the last stone.

DP Array:
dp[i] represents the minimum cost to reach stone i from stone 1.

Transitions:
From stone i, the frog can jump to stone i+1 or i+2. The cost of jumping to i+1 is |h[i] - h[i+1]|, 
and to i+2 is |h[i] - h[i+2]|.

DP Update:
The value of dp[i] is updated as the minimum of the costs to reach it from the two possible previous stones.

Result:
The final result is dp[N-1], the minimum cost to reach the last stone.
