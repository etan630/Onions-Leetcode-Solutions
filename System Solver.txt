Gaussian Elimination:
- Forward Elimination: Converts the matrix to an upper triangular form.
- Back Substitution: Finds the solution by solving from the last row upwards.

Matrix Check:
- Rank Calculation: Determines if the system has a unique solution based on the rank of the matrix.

Process:
- Swap Function: Handles row exchanges for better numerical stability.
- Check Function: Validates if a unique solution is possible.
- Solve Function: Runs elimination and checks for a solution.
