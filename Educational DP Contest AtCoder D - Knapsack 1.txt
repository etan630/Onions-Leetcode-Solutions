Dynamic Programming (DP) Array: 
Use a 1D DP array dp[j] where dp[j] represents the maximum value achievable with a knapsack capacity of j.

Item Processing: 
For each item, update the DP array to include the itemâ€™s value if
it can be accommodated within the current capacity j.

Item Inclusion: 
Iterate through items in reverse capacity order to ensure each item is only considered once per capacity level.

Max Value Update: Use previously computed values to determine the best 
possible value for each capacity incrementally.
