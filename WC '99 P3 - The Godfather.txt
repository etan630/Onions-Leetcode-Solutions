Random Sampling: 
It generates 30,000 random points within a rectangle of width L and height 1.

Curve Comparison: 
For each point, it checks if the y-coordinate of the point is below or on the 
curve exp(âˆ’x^2) where x is the x-coordinate of the point.

Estimate Area: The area under the curve is estimated using the ratio of points that 
fall under the curve to the total number of points, multiplied by the area of the rectangle.
