1. Base Case: If the array has only one element, return it, as no further splitting is needed.

2. Splitting: For arrays with more than one element, the array is split into three equal parts.

3. Recursive Call: Each of these three parts is further split and processed using the same function (divConqHelper). This recursive splitting continues until segments of one element are reached.

4. Reassembly: After processing the three parts, they are reassembled, but their order is changed:
The third part is placed first.
The first part is placed second.
The second part is placed third.
