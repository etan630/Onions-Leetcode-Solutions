Edge Counting:
The code counts the number of edges in the adjacency matrix. A tree with n nodes 
must have exactly n-1 edges. If the number of edges is not n-1, the matrix does not represent a tree.

Symmetry Check:
Since the graph is undirected, the adjacency matrix must be symmetric. 
The code checks for this by ensuring tree[i][j] == tree[j][i] for all i and j.

Cycle Detection and Connectivity Check (BFS):
The BFS traversal ensures that the graph is connected (all nodes are visited) 
and that no cycles exist (no back edges). If any node is revisited through a 
different parent, a cycle is detected, and the graph is not a tree.

Final Check:
If the graph has n-1 edges, is connected, and has no cycles, then it is a tree. 
Otherwise, it's not.
