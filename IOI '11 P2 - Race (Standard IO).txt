Centroid Decomposition:
The code uses centroid decomposition to efficiently handle tree queries. 
A centroid is a node that minimizes the size of the largest subtree when removed. 
This helps in breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.

DFS for Distance Calculation:
The dfsFindPairs function finds pairs of distances from the centroid where their 
sum equals the target length K. The dfsStorePairs function stores the shortest
distance from the centroid to any node with a given weight.

Finding Minimum Number of Highways:
For each centroid, the code finds all valid pairs of distances that sum up to 
K and tracks the minimum number of edges required to achieve this distance.

Handling Multiple Subtrees:
The tree is divided into subtrees rooted at the centroid, and each subtree 
is processed recursively to ensure all possible paths are considered.
