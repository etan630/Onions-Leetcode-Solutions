Graph Representation:
The code represents the billabongs and trails as an undirected graph using an adjacency list.

Finding Tree Diameter:
It uses BFS (Breadth-First Search) to determine the diameter of the tree, which
is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. The diameter is found by 
performing BFS twice: once from an arbitrary node to find the farthest node, and then 
from that farthest node to find the farthest node from it.

Finding Tree Radius:
The radius is determined from each node, which is used to find the shortest 
maximum distance from the node to the farthest node in the tree.

Processing the Tree:
The code identifies key nodes (centers) and calculates the possible longest path 
after adding new trails of length L. It considers cases where:
  The longest path includes two main centers plus one new trail.
  The longest path includes three centers with two new trails.

Final Computation:
It evaluates possible longest travel times considering the new trails and 
updates the maximum distance accordingly.
