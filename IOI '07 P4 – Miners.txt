Dynamic Programming Approach:
The code uses dynamic programming (DP) to determine the maximum coal production 
by strategically allocating food shipments to two mines.

State Representation:
States are represented by the last two shipments (or fewer if there haven't been 
that many). Each state reflects the combination of the last shipments and their types.

State Transitions:
The precompute_transitions function calculates possible transitions from any state 
with a new shipment, including the resulting coal production.

DP Table Update:
The DP table dp[i][j] tracks the maximum coal production with states i and j for the two mines. 
For each shipment, the DP table is updated based on possible transitions.

Final Result:
After processing all shipments in reverse, the DP table at dp[0][0] contains the 
maximum coal production achievable.
