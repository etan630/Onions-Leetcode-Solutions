Filter Items: 
Only consider items with positive values (since items with zero or negative values 
do not contribute to the total value).

Compute Minimum Size: 
Sum the capacities of all items with positive values. This is because the 
smallest knapsack that can fit all valuable items will maximize the value since it includes all items.
