Objective:
Maximize Koosaga's joy given a number of cacti and matroids, where joy is computed as C × uc + M × um.
Constraint: The total number of cacti and matroids C+M must not exceed k

Approach:
Brute Force: 
- The code explores all possible combinations of cacti and matroids, ensuring C+M≤k.
- For each valid combination, compute the joy C×uc+M×um.
- Track the maximum joy value found.

Implementation Details:
- Iterate through all possible counts of cacti (i) and matroids (j) within the constraint i+j≤k.
Calculate joy for each combination and update the maximum joy if the current value is higher.
