Binary Search Approach: The code uses binary search between a lower bound of 1.0 and an upper bound,
which is Z^(1/Y) to approximate X
 
Power Calculation: The calcPower function simulates the repeated exponentiation. 
If the result is greater than or equal to Z, the search narrows down; otherwise, it widens.

Precision: The binary search continues until the difference between the 
bounds is less than a small threshold (1e-6) to ensure accuracy.
