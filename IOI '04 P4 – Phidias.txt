DP Table:
dp[w][h] represents the minimum waste area when cutting a slab of size w × h.

Initialization:
Initialize dp[w][h] to w * h (the area of the slab) assuming the entire slab is 
wasted if no plates of size w × h are found.

Plate Check:
If a plate of size w × h is desired, set dp[w][h] to 0.

State Transition:
Update dp[w][h] by checking all possible vertical and horizontal cuts, combining the 
results to find the minimum waste.

Final Result:
The minimum waste for the original slab size W × H is given by dp[W][H].
